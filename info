TUT 1 - Week 2
Time: 13:00 - 14:00

In the lab, we got started with the lab assignment. This lab assignment taught me how to use the GitHub repository feature as well as how to write a Java file and compile it. The lab assignment made me practice writing in Java code which taught me about classes and the Java syntax. 

The lab tutorial was useful as the TA supervised me and assisted me in creating my GitHub repository. Also, I was able to start my assignment and get familiar with Java.
